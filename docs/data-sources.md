# GCRM Data-Source Ledger

The authoritative record of every external data source **evaluated** for GCRM's
situational-awareness map — what's live, what was rejected (and why), what's deferred,
and where to hunt next. The twice-daily **Signal Hunter** routine reads this FIRST every
run and updates it every run, so the program *compounds* and never re-chases a source
that's already live or already rejected.

**Acceptance bar** (a candidate must clear all six to go on the map):
1. **Authoritative** — a government agency / recognized national body / established
   scientific org. No scrapers, no unofficial mirrors.
2. **Auth-free or trivially keyed** — public endpoint; if a key is needed it goes in the
   gitignored `secrets.env` (never committed). Prefer key-free.
3. **Machine-readable** — JSON / GeoJSON / XML / CAP / RSS / CSV that parses deterministically.
4. **Geocoded** — lat/lon per record so it plots as a map dot. A NON-geo source does NOT
   go on the map (it would be a count with zero dots — see `cisa_kev`); it may live in
   the `ee_sources::registry()` catalog for a future non-map surface.
5. **Fresh** — actually updating; note the recency of the newest record.
6. **Non-duplicative** — adds coverage (geography / domain / modality) the live feeds lack.

Plus the **signal-meaningfulness** rule: every value plotted must carry real-world meaning
and units. A raw internal/absolute number with no operator meaning (e.g. an absolute river
gauge level with no per-station flood baseline) is a "nonsense number" and must NOT ship.

**Sandbox + ingestion paths.** The cloud Signal-Hunter sandbox allowlists only GitHub +
crates — most live gov/OSINT hosts 403 *in-sandbox*, so the routine **live-verifies via
web fetch** (out-of-band), not curl. Two ways a source lands:
- **Path A — live feed:** the connector fetches the live endpoint; prod (full network)
  serves it after deploy. Default for publicly-reachable feeds.
- **Path B — mirrored snapshot:** for data NOT freely live-reachable (licensed / manual /
  awkward), incorporate it as a GitHub-mirrored snapshot — a connector that reads a
  `raw.githubusercontent.com` mirror (reachable from both sandbox and prod) or a committed
  snapshot file, refreshed by a noted local/manual job. This is the "download + incorporate
  if I can't access it live" path.

## LIVE — wired into the map (`src/osint.rs` fan-out) — do not re-add

| source_id | EventKind | Authority | Notes |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|-------|
| `usgs` | Earthquake | USGS | global quakes |
| `eqcanada` | Earthquake | NRCan | dense Canadian seismicity |
| `emsc` | Earthquake | EMSC | global, denser outside Americas |
| `cwfis` | Wildfire | NRCan | satellite thermal hotspots (FRP) |
| `firms` | Wildfire | NASA | global thermal hotspots (key in secrets.env) |
| `cwfis_activefires` | Wildfire | NRCan/CIFFC | national agency fire ground-state (stage+size) |
| `gvp_volcano` | Volcano | Smithsonian GVP | recent/ongoing eruptions |
| `nws` | Weather | US NWS | US-only alerts |
| `eccc_alerts` | Weather | ECCC | Canada weather warnings/watches |
| `eccc_marine` | Weather | ECCC | Great-Lakes marine warnings |
| `eccc_aqhi` | AirQuality | ECCC | air-quality stations (smoke proxy) |
| `healthmap` | Health | HealthMap | global disease clusters |
| `eonet` | (natural) | NASA EONET | wildfires/storms/volcanoes |
| `gdacs` | (disaster) | GDACS | global disaster alerts |
| `opensky` | Aircraft | OpenSky | live aircraft positions (anon often rate-limited) |
| `navcanada` | Aircraft | NAV CANADA | NOTAM airspace/aerodrome hazards |
| `ontario511` | Transport | Ontario MTO | provincial road events |
| `drivebc` | Transport | BC MoTI | provincial road events (Open511) |
| `alberta511` | Transport | Gov of Alberta | provincial road events |
| `quebec511` | Transport | Transports Québec | provincial road events (MTMD WFS) |
| `cbsa_bwt` | Transport | CBSA | 29 land border-crossing wait times |
| `ucdp_ged` | Conflict | UCDP / Uppsala Univ. | georeferenced conflict events (candidate GED), fatalities→severity. Auth-free direct CSV (the live API is now token-gated); version-discovered from the downloads page. Monthly cadence. Fills the Conflict layer ACLED can't. |
| `digitraffic_ais` | Vessel | Fintraffic (Finland) | live Baltic AIS — vessels in abnormal nav state (aground/NUC/restricted) loud, moving commercial traffic faint; routine moored/anchored dropped. Auth-free (Digitraffic-User header + gzip). Fills the previously-empty Vessel layer; Baltic = on-mission (NATO/Russia maritime). |
| `acled` | Conflict | ACLED | global armed conflict — **PERMANENTLY DORMANT as a live feed**: Open access has NO API (confirmed by ACLED 2026-06-14; API needs a paid license). Only *aggregated weekly* data is public → a **Path-B snapshot** candidate, superseded for now by `ucdp_ged` (which gives live georeferenced conflict). |

**Registry catalog only (NON-geo, deliberately NOT on the map):**
`cisa_kev` (US CISA known-exploited CVEs, Cyber), `cccs` (Canadian Centre for Cyber
Security advisories, Cyber). Both are non-geo → they would plot as a count with zero
dots. Ready for a future cyber-advisories panel/surface, not the map.

**Finance panel (not the map):** `yahoo` (Market) → Finance Radar.

## REJECTED — do NOT re-chase (recon 2026-06-14)

- **Alert Ready / NAAD CAP (Pelmorex)** — authoritative + auth-free, but overwhelmingly
  re-ships the `eccc_alerts` stream; no single feed URL (must list a day-folder, fetch
  each signed CAP-XML, dedupe en/fr + Update/Cancel), and the live push is a TCP socket.
  Large ingest for a ~few-% unique residue. Skip unless the civil/EMO slice is specifically
  wanted (then filter status=Actual, sender≠ECCC).
- **ECCC hydrometric-realtime** — authoritative/geocoded/fresh, but carries NO severity
  signal: it's raw absolute gauge level/discharge, incomparable across rivers without each
  station's flood-stage baseline (which the API doesn't provide). A plotted "2.79 m" dot is
  exactly the "nonsense number" the signal-meaningfulness rule forbids. Revisit ONLY if a
  per-station historical-quantile baseline is precomputed (turns level→anomaly). v2-scale.
- **NTWC tsunami messages (tsunami.gov)** — usable + geocoded, but US-NOAA-authoritative,
  not a Canadian agency (fails bar 1 for the Canada focus). Reconsider only if the program
  scope broadens to "official-issuer-for-Canada" sources.
- **NRCan space weather** — no clean machine-readable, geocoded, per-record product (K-index
  is a JS-drawn image; F10.7 is a single-site global scalar). No map fit.

---

## DEFERRED — verified OK, adopt when the caveat is resolved

- **IESO Ontario grid demand** (`reports-public.ieso.ca/public/RealtimeTotals/PUB_RealtimeTotals.xml`)
  — live + authoritative, but a single province-wide scalar (no per-record lat/lon). Only
  fits as ONE static Ontario marker; marginal map value. Adopt only if a single grid-load
  marker is explicitly wanted.
- **Avalanche Canada** (`api.avalanche.ca/forecasts/en/{products,areas}`) — authoritative,
  geocoded (join product.area.id↔areas feature.id, centroid). **Seasonal**: off-season
  returns "spring"/"norating" (0 plottable). Implement with an off-season-tolerant parser
  and gate the layer to light up ~late-Nov→Apr.
- **CCCS cyber** (`cccs`) — already a registry connector; lift onto a UI surface (a cyber
  panel), not the map.

---

## COVERAGE GAPS & HUNTING IDEAS — where to look next

Bias each run toward the least-covered axis below.

- **Vessel / AIS** — SEEDED 2026-06-14 with `digitraffic_ais` (Fintraffic, Baltic). Gap
  now: extend coverage beyond the Baltic — other authoritative auth-free AIS regions
  (Danish Maritime Authority, NOAA, port authorities) or a GitHub-mirrored snapshot.
- **Conflict** — SEEDED 2026-06-14 with `ucdp_ged` (Uppsala, live CSV). `acled` stays
  dormant (no Open API). Remaining: a higher-frequency conflict signal if one exists
  auth-free, or the ACLED aggregated-weekly Path-B snapshot.
- **Geography** — feeds are Canada/US-dense. Hunt authoritative regional feeds for
  Europe (Copernicus EMS, MeteoAlarm if it geocodes), Asia/Pacific (JMA quakes/tsunami,
  Australia BoM/GA), Latin America, Africa.
- **Domains under-covered** — power-grid stress (other ISOs), rail/pipeline incidents
  (TSB Canada, NTSB), dam/reservoir, drought, flood-WITH-baselines, lightning (if a geocoded
  near-real-time product exists), methane/industrial (GHGSat/Sentinel).
- **Cyber surface** — `cisa_kev` + `cccs` exist but aren't surfaced; a non-map cyber panel
  would unlock them.

## Run log

Newest first. One short entry per run: date, what was evaluated, what was adopted/rejected/
deferred, and the green-proof. Append; never rewrite history.

- **2026-06-15** (second run) — environmental block again, so a verified signal-meaningfulness
  fix on an existing layer rather than a half-wired source. **web fetch was 403 on EVERY
  non-GitHub host this session** — not just CDN-fronted gov hosts but normally bot-friendly
  ones too (NHC `CurrentStorms.json`, GDACS API, MeteoAlarm, JMA quake list, USGS GeoJSON,
  ReliefWeb API, EMSC `seismicportal.eu`, `api.open-meteo.com`, Wikipedia API). Only
  `raw.githubusercontent.com` resolved (confirmed positive against a known public raw file).
  So **no Path-A feed could be live-verified** (NHC, teed up last run, 403s) and **no Path-B
  snapshot could be built** (can't reach any origin to mirror it; the GitHub-mirrored
  conflict datasets a search surfaced were licensed (ACLED) or already-live (UCDP) — none
  fresh + authoritative + geocoded + non-duplicative). Candidates ruled out *this run only*
  (re-evaluate when web fetch reaches gov hosts; none REJECTED): **NHC** tropical cyclones
  (Path-A storm-domain win, still the top pick), **MeteoAlarm** Europe, **JMA** quakes
  (duplicative). Instead, **closed a signal gap on the OpenSky Aircraft layer** (up to 800
  plotted dots): it had **no `feed_detail` arm**, so every aircraft showed only "Aircraft" +
  time — a bare dot with no identifying read. Added a chip from OpenSky's state vector:
  emergency squawk first (`7500` hijack / `7600` radio-failure / `7700` emergency — the only
  intrinsic alert), else barometric altitude + ground speed in aviation units (`"36089 ft ·
  447 kn"`), else `"On ground"`. Offline test added; `cargo build --release` + full workspace
  suite green (gcrm 393 passed / 0 failed / 3 ignored; ee-sources 64; ee-view 60; ee-correlate
  79; ee-core 5). Next run, if web fetch reaches gov hosts: pick up **NHC tropical cyclones** (Path A).
- **2026-06-15** — no new source cleared the bar (environmental block), so a verified
  signal-meaningfulness fix instead. **web fetch was broadly 403 this session**: every
  CDN-fronted gov/OSINT host the fetcher tried returned HTTP 403 (NHC `CurrentStorms.json`,
  JMA quake list, NOAA `api.weather.gov`, USGS feeds, NASA EONET, EMSC `seismicportal.eu`,
  GDACS API, ReliefWeb API, GDELT geo, Wikipedia) — only `raw.githubusercontent.com`
  resolved. So no new **Path-A** gov feed could be live-verified, and the GitHub-hosted
  (**Path-B**-eligible) datasets found were either stale (GDIS ends 2018) or duplicative
  (USGS/quake mirrors) — none fresh + non-duplicative. Candidates ruled out *this run only*
  (re-evaluate when web fetch can reach gov hosts; none are REJECTED): **NHC** active
  tropical cyclones (`CurrentStorms.json` — new domain, would fill a storm gap; can't
  verify today), **JMA** quakes (duplicative of USGS/EMSC), **MeteoAlarm** Europe (geocode
  risk — region codes, not per-record lat/lon; unverified), **ReliefWeb** disasters
  (UN OCHA but country-centroid + duplicative of GDACS), **GDELT** geo conflict (geocode/
  meaningfulness risk, not strictly authoritative). Instead, **closed a signal gap on an
  existing top-tier layer**: `gdacs` (the global multi-hazard layer) had **no `feed_detail`
  arm**, so every disaster plotted as a bare dot with no severity. Added a chip surfacing
  the authoritative **alert level + hazard type + GDACS `severitydata.severitytext`**
  (e.g. "Orange · Earthquake · Magnitude 6.1M, Depth:10km"); long severity sentences are
  dropped so the chip can't dump a paragraph, degrading gracefully to "Red · Cyclone".
  Offline test added; `cargo build --release` + full suite green (391 passed, 0 failed, 3
  ignored). Next run, if web fetch reaches gov hosts: pick up **NHC tropical cyclones**
  (Path A) as the new-domain win.
- **2026-06-14** — filled the two biggest gaps with verified live feeds (Path A):
  `digitraffic_ais` (Fintraffic Baltic AIS → the empty Vessel layer; abnormal-nav-state
  loud, moving commercial faint, routine dropped; join locations+vessels by MMSI) and
  `ucdp_ged` (UCDP candidate-GED CSV → the Conflict layer ACLED can't fill; fatalities→
  severity, version-discovered URL, quote-aware CSV parser). Both live `errors=[]`
  (digitraffic_ais 800 / ucdp_ged 800); 64 ee-sources + 389 workspace tests green; clippy clean.
- **2026-06-14** (prompt optimization, not a hunt) — recorded two facts that reshape the
  hunt: (1) the cloud sandbox is GitHub-only, so live-verify via web fetch + added the
  Path-A/Path-B ingestion model above; (2) ACLED Open access has no API (paid license only)
  — `acled` is permanently dormant as a live feed; aggregated-weekly is a Path-B candidate.
  Next-target priority set to the empty Vessel/AIS layer.
- **2026-06-14** — Ledger seeded from the manual Canadian-feed recon (15 candidates,
  11 confirmed). Adopted to the map: `drivebc`, `alberta511`, `quebec511`,
  `cwfis_activefires`, `cbsa_bwt`, `navcanada`. Added `cccs` as a non-map registry
  connector. Rejected Alert Ready, hydrometric, NTWC tsunami, space weather (reasons above).
  All live with `errors=[]`; build + full test suite green.
