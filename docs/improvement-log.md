# GCRM Improvement Log

Append-only record of what each self-improvement run changed, the scorecard metric it moved,
and the green-proof. This is the anti-thrash memory: **read it before you act** so you build
on prior runs instead of repeating or reverting them. Newest entries at the top.

Format per entry:
```
## YYYY-MM-DD — <axis> — <one-line what>

## 2026-06-09 — legibility/honesty — surfaced live calibration evidence on the methodology page
- Item: roadmap 1.1b (now checked).
- Change: un-gated `mod backtest` (was `#[cfg(test)]`) and added `pub calibration_evidence_html()`,
  which renders the live per-analog table (model P vs anchor + Δ) and the aggregate Brier/RMSE/
  in-band. `server.rs` substitutes it into a new `{{CALIBRATION_EVIDENCE}}` placeholder in
  methodology.html at startup (mirrors `{{BASE_PATH}}`). Removed the hand-written calibration
  table — which had itself gone stale (it still showed ~65% for current-full) — so the page now
  shows numbers computed from the running model that cannot drift. Test-only helpers
  (`live_hot_2026`, `cross_entropy`) kept under `#[cfg(test)]` so the release binary stays clean.
- Metric moved: the calibration evidence is now ALSO operator-visible (not CI-only); test count
  349 → 350 (added `methodology_renders_live_calibration_evidence`). RUNTIME change this time
  (unlike 1.1/1.1a) — methodology page content changes; dashboard untouched.
- Proof: `cargo build --release` clean (no warnings); `cargo test --release` = 349 passed / 0
  failed / 1 ignored; the new test asserts the placeholder is substituted and Brier/in-band render.
- Notes: deploy gate is build+health+eyes (eyes covers the dashboard, which is unchanged); the
  readout runs at `ServerState::new` (4 deterministic scenario sims, negligible startup cost).

## 2026-06-09 — honesty/model — re-anchored current_2026 65%→60% (resolves the calibration gap)
- Item: roadmap 1.1a (now checked).
- Decision (Robert): the −4.9pp `current_2026` gap surfaced by the evidence harness was a STALE
  ANCHOR, not a model error. Mechanism analysis (`theater.rs` `concurrency_mult` + per-scenario
  l_sys): raising the model to the old 65% centre means lifting the breadth-saturation asymptote
  ~0.26→~0.34, which also pushes the REAL live read ~82%→~85-86% — eroding the off-the-0.90-peg
  resolution the 2026-06-03 saturating-breadth fix deliberately created. The saturation curve is
  monotonic, so no lever isolates current_2026 (breadth ~2) from the live read (breadth ~3);
  raising the model would partially REVERT that deliberate fix. Correct fix = reconcile the stale
  65% centre to the 60% the model produces by design (brink dominates breadth).
- Change: `src/backtest.rs` — current_2026 anchor centre 0.65→0.60 + reconciled the stale
  header/test comments (incl. dropping a pre-fix "live corpus ~45%" note). Band acceptance range
  left exactly as Robert set it (0.55–0.75). NO model constant touched.
- Metric moved: Brier 0.00060 → ~0.000002; RMSE 2.45pp → 0.14pp; in-band 4/4 (all anchors now
  within 0.2pp of centre).
- Proof: `cargo test --release` = 348 passed / 0 failed / 1 ignored. current_2026 60.10% vs
  60.0% centre (+0.10pp).
- Notes future runs MUST respect: current-full's intended centre is **~60% (NOT 65%)**. Do NOT
  "raise current_2026 to 65%" — it re-erodes the live-peg headroom. The live read itself is a
  separate question from this synthetic anchor.

## 2026-06-09 — honesty/model — calibration evidence harness (Brier/cross-entropy vs anchored centres)
- Item: roadmap 1.1 (now checked); spawned 1.1a + 1.1b.
- Change: added a proper-scoring calibration harness to `src/backtest.rs`. It scores the live
  model's P(WWIII) for the four hard-band analogs against Robert's expert-anchored band
  CENTRES (2 / 39 / 65 / 80 %) using Brier + cross-entropy, printed via `cargo test
  calibration_evidence_report -- --nocapture` and locked by 3 new tests (Brier math,
  cross-entropy math + clamping, and the in-band invariant). Deliberately NOT a
  tighter-than-band gate — that would fight legitimate live-targeted recalibration; it is
  evidence that the number is earned. No model behavior changed (no calibration constant touched).
- Metric moved: scorecard "Calibration evidence" *not measured* → **Brier 0.00060 / RMSE
  2.45pp / in-band 4/4**; test count **346 → 349**.
- Proof: `cargo test --release` = **348 passed / 0 failed / 1 ignored**. Evidence table:
  quiet 2.03% (+0.03pp), ukraine 38.84% (−0.16pp), current_2026 60.10% (−4.90pp),
  cuba 79.80% (−0.20pp).
- FINDING for future runs: **current_2026 is the calibration soft spot** (−4.9pp; it alone
  drives the RMSE — the other three anchors are within 0.2pp of centre). Captured as roadmap
  1.1a. This is the kind of thing the wide bands hid and the evidence number surfaces.
- Notes: harness is test-only (`backtest` is `#[cfg(test)]`); to surface it at runtime see 1.1b.

## 2026-06-09 — meta — installed the compounding self-improvement infrastructure
- Item: ad-hoc (program upgrade)
- Change: added `docs/roadmap.md` (prioritized, axis-organized backlog), `docs/scorecard.md`
  (the fitness function + prime directive), and this log. The routine now pulls from a shared
  backlog and records measured progress, instead of cold-starting and guessing each run. The
  cloud routine prompt was rewritten the same day to be mission-driven (honesty/legibility/
  awareness) with the safety rails intact, and to read+maintain these three files.
- Metric moved: new frontier — established the scorecard baseline (test count 346; build/
  tests/calibration-bands green; index ceiling 95).
- Proof: `cargo build --release` green (no-op rebuild, live binary already on `main`).
- Notes: axes rotate — bias each run toward the least-recently-advanced axis.

## 2026-06-09 — robustness — CORRECTION: the LLM enricher is already optimized (no rework)
- Item: roadmap 4.1
- Change: NONE — investigated and confirmed the "serial per-article enricher" is already a
  bounded-concurrent worker pool (`nlp_sidecar.rs`: `Semaphore` + `acquire_owned()` +
  `tokio::spawn`; the old serial `classify().await` is gone and the code comment says so).
  A standing memory and an earlier plan still described it as serial and "in scope to rework";
  that belief was **stale**. Corrected the memory; recorded the resolution here and in the
  roadmap so no future run re-chases it.
- Metric moved: none (invariant held) — but prevented future wasted runs.
- Proof: `nlp_sidecar.rs:118-225` (semaphore dispatch); `settings.yml:67-70` documents
  `concurrency: 2` as a GTX-1080 VRAM calibration (above 2 doubles latency).
- Notes future runs MUST respect: **do NOT "make the enricher concurrent" or raise
  `llm.concurrency`** — it's done, and the cap of 2 is hardware-correct on this box. This
  entry exists specifically so the loop stops re-discovering a solved problem.
